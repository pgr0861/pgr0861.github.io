Worked initially as an 3D Environment Artist for SCP: Secret Laboratory, helping ship the 14.0 Heavy Duty update, then promoted to Art Supervisor, where I supervised the art team for the 14.1 update. I primarily focused on creating trim and decal sheets while doing art passes for rooms and helping implement assets and environments into the engine.

I've worked on a lot of small projects throughout my time doing game development, from well before I was anywhere near the industry, primarily small indie games, on which I would always be a 3D or Texture Artist.
