Blood Atlas, Practical FX
---
Contract Work, just a few blood decals to be placed around for specific locations. Actually painted the blood platters (I say painted but more like splattered) on a piece of wood and turned them into alphas. Really enjoyed doing practical effects so I'll definitely do it more often in the future.
